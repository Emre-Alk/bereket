      # use of includes to prevent N+1 query and preload joined tables
      # Here's why both place and asso are specified:
      # Donation Belongs to Place:
      # The donations table has a place_id Fkey, so you can join the donations table with the places table via this key.
      # Place Belongs to Asso:
      # The places table has an asso_id Fkey, so you can join the places table with the assos table using this key.
      # To Filter by Asso:
      # If you want to filter donations by an attribute in asso (like asso_id),
      # you need to traverse both associations (Donation -> Place -> Asso).
      # That's why you need to include both place and asso in the joins

      # writing .includes(:place, :asso) like that, results in two separate joins (which is a solution):

      # join 'donation' to 'asso' (which give error because it requires a direct association)
